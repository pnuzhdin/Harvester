Harvester - data acquisition software.
Inspired by Yahoo! Harvester about which I can't found info except
http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/using-erlang-to-build-reliable-fault-tol/220600332

Scalable modular system which supports any data type (structured/semi-structured/not-structured, regular/stream),
protocols and storages (SQL/NOSQL).

Main goal is to create software infrastructure for Data collection from various sources and transfering data
(with some preprocessing maybe) to persistent storage or to processing system for future Data Mining.

May used as base for Web indexing software for example.
