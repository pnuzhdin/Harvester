Scalable modular system which supports any data type (structured/semi-structured/not-structured, regular/stream),
protocols and storages (SQL/NOSQL).

Main goal is to create software infrastructure for Data collection from various sources and transfering data
(with some preprocessing maybe) to persistent storage for the following processing (Data Mining).

May be used for Web indexing for example.
